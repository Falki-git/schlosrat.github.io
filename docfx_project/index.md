# Unofficial **KSP2 API Documentation**
## Site Contents
This site contains (unofficial) documentation for the Kerbal Space Program 2 Application Programming Interface. Although there is no source code here, you will find infomation useful to understanding what the game's internal methods and properties are, and how to access them.

This site is composed of two parts, Articles containing general information about modding KSP2 (how to use the API), and the API Documentation itself based on the 0.1.2 Early Access version of the game. These parts are available in the top bar of any page within this site, and from the Left Side Table of Contents menu of this page.

The Left Side Table of Contents menu for any page on this site includes a search field that filters the results displayed in the ToC based on what you're looking for. When in the Articles section, the ToC lists the articles available by title, and when in the API Documentation, the ToC shows all the API topic pages releavant to your surrent search terms. Each API topic page is hyperlinked to other relevant pages to aid site navigation.
