# How to Add Code Comments for XML
1. Locate the .cs file that contains the code you'd like to add or modify documentaition generating comments for
2. Open that file in the editor of your choice. Note that editing in Visual Studio or other similarly capable coding oriented editors may make the following steps easier and automate generation of some basic comments and structure
3. Navigate to the start of the method or the definition line for the object you would like to document
4. Insert a new blank line directly above and start a tripple slash /// comment. If your editor is a sufficiently smart coding-aware editor it may detect that you've started a tripple slash comment and start you out with some comments, but it may also start you out with some misinformation based on the stripped nature of the cs file.
