# KSP2 Modding Articles
This part of the API Documentation site contains articles on how to contribute to the site so that you can help make it a better and more useful resource to KSP2 modders. The minimal set of articles you should expect to find here are the following.

* [Adding/Editing Articles](AddArticles.md) covers how to add and edit articles here on this site.
* [Adding Documenting (XML) Comments to Code](AddCodeComments.md) covers what you need to do to be able to add or edit the XML code documentation included in this site. Note that the Assembly-CSharp.xml file that's generated based on the documenting comments can also be used in your development environment to enable intellisense comments for KSP2 types, methods, and objects.
* [How This Site is Made](HowMade.md) goes into details about how this site is made. This covers to process going from from an initial unmodified Assembly-CSharp.dll file to what we have here, a nicely organized and extensible resource for anyone looking for information about the the internal methods, classes, objects, etc. of the game - *without exposing any actual internal game code!*

See the [KSP2 Modding Wiki](https://wiki.spacewarp.org/wiki/Main_Page) for a lot more information relevant to modding KSP2.
