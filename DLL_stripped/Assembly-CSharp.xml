<member name="P:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.MaxTotalPatches">
    <summary>
    The maximum limit on the number of patches. The default value = 10. This member can be get, but not set.
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="P:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.Orbiter">
    <summary>
    The ObiterComponent object this class is associated with. This member can be get, but not set.
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="P:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.CurrentTrajectory">
    <summary>
    A list of PatchedConicOrbits. May be given an index to obtain a particular trajectory. Itâ€™s basically a list of all the trajectories currently associated with this Orbiter object, and you can do things with it like any list. The length of the list will be no longer than MaxTotalPatches, with list members being chronologically organized from the patch that occurs first to the last patch. Unused members are null. This member can be get, but not set.
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="P:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.PatchesAhead">
    <summary>
    The number of patches ahead. This member can be get or set. It is set in the private method PatchedConicSolver.CalculatePatchList()
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.OnDestroy">
    <summary>
    First tests to see if the Orbiter object is null. If it is, then it returns immediately. Otherwise, it will remove the handler for OnReferenceBodyChange which was added by the OnStart method.
    </summary>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.OnStart">
    <summary>
    First tests to see if the Orbiter object is null. If it is, then it returns immediately. Otherwise, it will remove the handler for OnReferenceBodyChange which was added by the OnStart method.
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.OnUpdate">
    <summary>
    Adds a new handler for the Orbiter.OnReferenceBodyChange method so that OnReferenceBodyChange will be called when necessary. It then sets the private _patchLimit to be the max of PersistentProfileManager.ConicPatchLimit and 1, adds this.Orbiter.PatchedConicsOrbit to the CurrentTrajectory list, and similarly adds any remaining patches from 1 to MaxTotalPatches.
    </summary>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.CalculatePatchList">
    <summary>
    You'd think calling this would cause the patch list to be updated, wouldn't you? Well, you're wrong. Deal with it.
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.SetPatchesInactive(List{KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicsOrbit},System.Int32)">
    <summary>
    Accepts a list of patches (i.e., CurrentTrajectory) and (optionally) a starting index for the list (defaults to 0). For each list member from the starting index to the end of the list, the member's ActivePatch property is set to false.
    NOTE: When called by ManeuverPlanSolver.UpdateManeuverTrajectory(), this method is called after calling ManeuverPlanSolver.SetPatchesInactive.

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.InitializeFirstPatch">
    <summary>
    Initialize the first patch in the patchlist.
    </summary>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.SetTarget(KSP.Sim.impl.CelestialBodyComponent)">
    <summary>
    Accepts a CelestialBodyComponent and uses that to set the private _targetBody. This sets the target to be used when generating the patch list.
    </summary>
    <param name="targetBody"></param>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.FindPatchContainingUT(System.Double)">
    <summary>
    Accepts a double (the universal time of interest) and returns the PatchedConicOrbit for the patch associated with that time.

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.DecreasePatchLimit">
    <summary>
    Decreases the current setting of the private _pathcLimit property by 1 to a value that is never less than 1.
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.OnReferenceBodyChange(KSP.Sim.impl.OrbiterComponent,KSP.Sim.impl.CelestialBodyComponent)">

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.IncreasePatchLimit">
    <summary>
    Increases the current setting of the private _pathcLimit property by 1 to a value that is never more than 5.
    </summary>
</member>

<member name="M:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.RefreshPatchLimit">
    <summary>
    Clamps the current setting of the private _pathcLimit property to be between 1 and 5 inclusively.
    </summary>

<member name="T:KSP.Sim.impl.PatchedConicSolver.SolverParameters">
    <summary>
    Defines the parameters needed for the solver with default values assigned to maxGeometrySolverIterations (25), maxTimeSolverIterations (50), and outerReaches (1E+20).
